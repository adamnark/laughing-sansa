NOTES:

	ENDGAME happens not only when there's no more options to create a four, but also
	when there's only one player left.
	One peculiar scenario is when there are two players left, one with 1 card, the 
	other with 3. The second player requests the only card left from the first player,
	completing a four. 
	The game will end with the second player as the only player left (even though he
	has a four in his hand).

	EACH card has the same number of serieses as all the other cards. For example, 
	if one card is a member of two serieses, then we assume all other cards are
	members of two serieses.
